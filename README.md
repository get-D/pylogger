It's part of a learning exercise in a crash course from **Grant Collins** to help beginners understand:

- Python scripting basics  
- How input event tracking works  
- Logging and writing data to files  
- How modules like `pynput` (or similar) can be used for event monitoring

> **Note:** This is *not* a production-ready logger. It’s designed to teach concepts — not for deployment.
